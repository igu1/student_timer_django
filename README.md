# ⏰ Student Timer (Django) 1 year hackathon
*A hackathon project that actually worked*  

## What is this?  
Unlike certain projects that got destroyed by Gradle demons (👀 looking at you, Disaster Management App),  
this one **made it to the finish line** — and even grabbed **2nd Prize 🥈** at the hackathon.  

It’s a **study timer app** built with Django:  
- Simple  
- Minimal  
- Beautiful & elegant UI  
- Actually works™ ✅  

## Why this idea?  
Because it wasn’t an *open idea* hackathon, we had to go with something real, practical, and useful.  
So we picked a **study timer** — because students + deadlines = eternal suffering.  

## Features 🎉  
- ⏱️ Study timer to keep you on track  
- 🔔 Alarm support (yes, it rings)  
- 📚 Subject management (organize your chaos)  
- 🎨 Minimal, clean, elegant UI (your eyes will thank you)  
- 🥈 Officially good enough to win 2nd place

git clone https://github.com/igu1/student_timer_django.git
